# Ideabox

🎊 [Check it out!](https://reneepinna.github.io/ideaBox/) 🎊

### 💡 Abstract

The project builds a website where users can create, save, favorite and delete idea cards. There are two input fields one for the title and the other for the body. When the user clicks save, a card is generated lower down on the page with those inputs creating a card with that information. In the header of the card there is a large "X" for the delete button and a star icon so the user can add the card to their favorites. The user can click the "Show Starred Ideas" button to see their favorite idea cards. That button can toggle into the "Show All Ideas" button and when clicked it will show all of the idea cards.

### 🖇️ Learning Goals:

* Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp.

* Understand how a developer might separate the data model from the DOM model.

* Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed.

* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness, SRP, and purity.


### 🎆 Wins 

* Completing the project on time with a day to spare

* Deciding to forego the second global array - it improved the readability of the code.

* Having our the application look exactly like the comp

* We were able to create a scroll feature for the page and the cards while also making the scroll bar invisible.

### 🔥 Challenges:

* Being stuck on the logic that affected functionality when toggling between pages.

* Being unable to separate the favorited cards from the cards that were not favorited.
